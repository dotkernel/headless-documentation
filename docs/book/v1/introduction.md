# Introduction

The principle of a Headless Platform is to decouple the User Interface (frontend) from the backend services.
The responses from the platform are then used by another system, such as a website or mobile app.

Its design leads to a great deal of versatility in the setup and configuration.
Here are some of the advantages of the Headless Platform:

- The ability to have multiple frontends, each targeted to various end-users, like desktop vs mobile, iOS vs Android etc. 
- Different frontends (websites) for various niches (younger vs older users) and countries (including localization).
- Ability to customise separate frontends in terms of design, as well as available features.
