# Migrations

When we talk about **migration**, we primarily refer to the **transfer of functionality** (the codebase) from one platform to another, more often from an older architecture like MVC, to a modern one like middleware.
Still, a complex platform migration may include:

- Replatforming - e.g. from on-premises to the cloud.
- Refactoring - to improve readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
- Database or storage migration - to improve execution time and/or security.

The **migration of the software codebase** is the process of moving a software system's source code **to another environment**, which can involve:

- Updating to a newer version of a language or framework.
- Changing the infrastructure e.g. moving from SQL to NoSQL databases.
- Replacing designs for security and compliance requirements.

The process ensures that software is kept functional, compatible, and secure as the technology evolves.
It is also the perfect opportunity to implement modern design patterns recommended by the development community.
