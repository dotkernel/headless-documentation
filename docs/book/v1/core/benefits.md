# Benefits of the Core Submodule

This design pattern ensures:

- Design flexibility.
- Scalability based on future requirements.
- Consistent, enterprise-level growth, while also being suited for smaller applications.
- The ability to split the work to multiple developers.
- Easier bugfixes and onboarding.

As your platform expands, each new application connects to the Dotkernel Headless Platform via the central API which services everything the other applications require.
This ensures consistency throughout your platform, while allowing any number of outside connections as requirements arise.
