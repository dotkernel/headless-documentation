# Introduction

Dotkernel API is a REST API based on the Mezzio skeleton.
The API is the root or the Dotkernel Headless Platform.

Dotkernel API:

- Ensures that you build a cohesive system that contains an API-first backend with the same architecture and standards support as other Dotkernel tools and applications.
- Has a PSR-Compliant Middleware Stack to promote a lean, modular architecture and create a common ground between components from various sources.
- Implements [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) (HTTP message interfaces) and [PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/) (HTTP Server Request Handlers) as defined by the [PHP Framework Interop Group](https://www.php-fig.org/).
